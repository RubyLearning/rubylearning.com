                <h4>Week 4</h4>
                <p><br /><strong><span style="color:red;">L4E1</span></strong>: Why is the output of this program:</p>
                <pre><code>def method
 a = 50
 puts a
end
a = 10
method
puts a</code></pre>
                <p>as shown below?<br />50<br />10</p>
                <p><strong><span style="color:red;">ANS</span></strong>: The explanation is given as comments in the code below:</p>
                <pre><code># Demonstrates that methods as well as the main program, have a local scope.
# That is,  variables with the same name can exist without interfering with
# those from another scope.
def method
  a = 50 # Creates a new variable named a, local to 'method'
  puts a # Uses methods local variable
end

a = 10
method  # uses the local a variable of method
puts a  # uses L4E1s own, local a variable.</code></pre>

                <p><br /><strong><span style="color:red;">L4E2</span></strong>: This is a non-programming exercise. Try to discover the difference between the methods:</p>
                <pre><code>to_str, to_s</code></pre>
                <p>Show examples if you can.</p>
                <p><strong><span style="color:red;">ANS</span></strong>: <strong>to_str</strong> - Synonym for <strong>String#to_s</strong>. <strong>to_str</strong> is used by methods such as <strong>String#concat</strong> to convert their arguments to a string. Unlike <strong>to_s</strong>, which is supported by almost all classes, <strong>to_str</strong> is normally implemented only by those classes that act like strings. Of the built-in classes, only <strong>String</strong> implements <strong>to_str</strong>.</p>

                <p><br /><strong><span style="color:red;">L4E3</span></strong>: Thanks to Marcos Souza for this exercise. A plain text file has the following contents:</p>

                <p><br /><strong><span style="color:red;">L4E5</span></strong>: Given the following Ruby code snippet:</p>
                <pre><code>a = (1930...1951).to_a
puts a[rand(a.size)]</code></pre>
                <p>When you run this program, which of the following values will not be displayed?</p>
                <pre><code>   1. 1929
   2. 1930
   3. 1945
   4. 1950
   5. 1951
   6. 1952
</code></pre>
                <p>Explain why that value will not be displayed.</p>
                <p><strong><span style="color:red;">ANS</span></strong>: The three-dot range operator creates a range that excludes the specified high value (1951 in this problem). (1930...1951).to_a converts the range to a list using the to_a method. We pass in the size of the array to rand method, and it returns an integer between 0 and size-1, which is then used as an index to the array.</p>

                <p><br /><strong><span style="color:red;">L4E6</span></strong>: Given a string s = 'key=value', create two strings s1 and s2 such that s1 contains key and s2 contains value. <em>Hint</em>: Use some of the String functions. Call this program p021rangesex.rb</p>
                <p><strong><span style="color:red;">ANS</span></strong>: The code is:</p>
                <pre><code># p021rangesex.rb
s = 'key=value'

# If range supplied to a string, as below, a new String is created

Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.<br /><br />From Chris Pine's Book.</p>
                <p>For example:<br /><br />You enter: Hello Grandma<br />Grandma responds: HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!<br />You enter: HELLO GRANDMA<br />Grandma responds: NO, NOT SINCE 1938!</p>
                <p><strong><span style="color:red;">ANS</span></strong>: The code is:</p>
                <pre><code>a = ( 1930...1951).to_a
puts 'Enter your response: '
STDOUT.flush
until (response = gets.chomp).eql?('BYE')

                <p><br /><strong><span style="color:red;">L4E8</span></strong>: First of all, I'd like to thank Peter Cooper for allowing me to use this exercise.<br /><br />The application you're going to develop will be a text analyzer. You will be working on it this and next week. Your Ruby code will read in text supplied in a separate file, analyze it for various patterns and statistics, and print out the results for the user. It's not a 3D graphical adventure or a fancy Web site, but text processing programs are the bread and butter of systems administration and most application development. They can be vital for parsing log files and user-submitted text on Web sites, and manipulating other textual data. With this application you'll be focusing on implementing the features quickly, rather than developing an elaborate object-oriented structure, any documentation, or a testing methodology.<br /><br />Your text analyzer will provide the following basic statistics:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Character count</li>
                  <li>Character count (excluding spaces)</li>
                  <li>Line count</li>
                  <li>Word count</li>
                  <li>Sentence count</li>
                  <li>Paragraph count</li>
                  <li>Average number of words per sentence</li>
                  <li>Average number of sentences per paragraph</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In the last two cases, the statistics are easily calculated from the word count, sentence count, and paragraph count. That is, once you have the total number of words and the total number of sentences, it becomes a matter of a simple division to work out the average number of words per sentence.<br /><br />Before you start to code, the first step is to get some test data that your analyzer can process. You can find the text at:<br /><a href="http://rubylearning.com/data/text.txt">http://rubylearning.com/data/text.txt</a><br /><br />Save the file in the same folder as your other Ruby programs and call it text.txt. Your application will read from text.txt by default (although you'll make it more dynamic and able to accept other sources of data later on).<br /><br />Let me outline the basic steps you need to follow:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Load in a file containing the text or document you want to analyze.</li>
                  <li>As you load the file line by line, keep a count of how many lines there are (one of your statistics taken care of).</li>
                  <li>Put the text into a string and measure its length to get your character count.</li>
                  <li>Temporarily remove all whitespace and measure the length of the resulting string to get the character count excluding spaces.</li>
                  <li>Split on whitespace to find out how many words there are.</li>
                  <li>Split on full stops (.), '!' and '?' to find out how many sentences there are.</li>
                  <li>Split on double newlines to find out how many paragraphs there are.</li>
                  <li>Perform calculations to work out the averages.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Create a new, blank Ruby source file and save it as analyzer.rb in your Ruby folder.</p>
                <p><strong><span style="color:red;">ANS</span></strong>: Here's the code for the following:</p>

                <p><br /><strong><span style="color:red;">L5E6</span></strong>: Here's code for the part of a game that saves the game state to a file. As a deterrent against cheating, when the game loads a save file it performs a simple check against the file's modification time. If it differs from the timestamp recorded inside the file, the game refuses to load the save file.<br /><br />The save_game method is responsible for recording the timestamp:</p>
                <pre><code>def save_game(file)
 score = 1000
 open(file, "w") do |f|
 f.puts(score)
 f.puts(Time.new.to_i)
 end
end</code></pre>
                <p>The load_game method is responsible for comparing the timestamp within the file to the time the filesystem has associated with the file. Write the load_game(file) method.<br /><br />This mechanism can detect simple forms of cheating:</p>
                <pre><code>save_game("game.sav")
sleep(2)
load_game("game.sav") # => "Your saved score is 1000."
# Now let's cheat by increasing our score to 9000
open("game.sav", "r+b") { |f| f.write("9") }
load_game("game.sav") # RuntimeError: I suspect you of cheating.</code></pre>
                <p>Since it's possible to modify a file's times with tools like the Unix touch command, you shouldn't depend on these methods to defend you against a skilled attacker actively trying to fool your program.<br /><br />Read up on <strong>sleep</strong> method and <strong>Time</strong> class.</p>
