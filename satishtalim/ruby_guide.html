                  <li><strong>What are the prerequisites and where do I get more information on these prerequisites?</strong> You must have some previous programming background in any programming language and the focus of the lessons would be more towards application programming.</li>

                  <li><strong>Is there a project to work on?</strong> Yes. You shall independently work on a small project after we have covered a few lessons.</li>
