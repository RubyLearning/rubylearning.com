                <h3>FAQ Answers</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li><a name="q1"><strong>What are the course fees for the various Ruby related courses at RubyLearning?</strong></a><br />The course fees for the various Ruby related course like Core Ruby, Ruby Metaporgramming, Sinatra etc. are announced at <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">RubyLearning.org</a> on a per batch basis.<br />The nominal cost of these courses helps RubyLearning maintain the RubyLearning sites and provide quality content to you.</li>
                  <li><a name="q2"><strong>What payment method do you accept?</strong></a><br />Payment for these courses is via <strong>Paypal</strong>. Normally, your payment will be processed within seconds, and your enrollment will be completed immediately.</li>

                  <li><a name="q5"><strong>How do I register for the new batch of the Core Ruby course?</strong></a><br /><ul>

Everyday starting 13th, you should log into the course at a time convenient to you (there is no fixed time during the day, to start with your lessons). Read thro' that particular day's lesson, understand the same, solve the examples / assignments given in that lesson. Then attempt the quiz (if any) pertaining to that lesson and finally the exercises. If at any time you are stuck, just post your questions in the relevant forum thread of that lesson.

Past participants will confirm that they learned the best by active participation.</li>
                  <li><a name="q12"><strong>How much time do I need to spend online for a course, in a day?</strong></a><br />This will vary from person to person. All depends upon your comfort level and the amount of time you want to spend on a particular lesson or task.</li>
                  <li><a name="q13"><strong>Are teachers like Satish and Victor available 24x7?</strong></a><br />Satish is based in India and is normally available all days of the week from 6 am to 6 pm (India time).

                  <li><a name="q14"><strong>Can I directly talk with the mentors or are all discussions through the forums only?</strong></a><br />Normally everything related to the course is through the forum(s). You can send a private message to Satish, if you feel that you want to communicate something important or urgently.</li>
                  <li><a name="q15"><strong>Is there any specific set time for feedback (e.g., any mentor responds to me within 24 hours?)</strong></a><br />Normally somebody should answer your query / question within 24 - 48 hours.</li>

This has been provided as a convenience and normally some of the Mentors are online there. Check out <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rubylearning.org&amp;uio=Mj10cnVlJjQ9dHJ1ZSY5PXRydWUmMTE9MjU2d9">RubyLearning's IRC channel</a>.</li>
                  <li><a name="q19"><strong>How many mentors are there for the course?</strong></a><br />There are normally over 2 to 5 Mentors per course.</li>
                  <li><a name="q20"><strong>How do the mentors get chosen?</strong></a><br />All the Mentors are devoting their time and energy voluntarily. Normally, the best students from a batch (based on their previous software experience and performance in the course) are offered a chance to help out as Mentor for the next batch onwards.</li>
                  <li><a name="q21"><strong>How do the mentors participate during the course?</strong></a><br />The mentors would help solve your questions / queries and also guide you on something which you have not followed in the course.

                  <li><a name="q24"><strong>How do I quit from a course?</strong></a><br />We wouldn't like that to happen. However, in case you want to 'quit' from a course or for some reason want to un-subscribe, kindly message Satish Talim or email him at satish [at] rubylearning [dot] org</li>
