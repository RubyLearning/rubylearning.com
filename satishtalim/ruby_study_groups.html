                <h1>Ruby Study Groups</h1>

                  <p>A Ruby Study Group can be helpful when you are trying to learn information and concepts and preparing for class discussions and tests. Read to learn about the benefits of a study group.  Then read on to learn about how to start a study group and the characteristics of a successful study group. Finally, be sure to read about the possible pitfalls of a study group.</p>
                  <h4>Benefits of a Ruby Study Group</h4>
                  <p>A study group can be beneficial in many ways.  Here are the most important benefits:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>A support group can "pick you up" when you find that your motivation to study is slipping. The other group members can be a source of encouragement.</li>
                    <li>You may be reluctant to ask a question in class. You will find it easier to do so in a small study group.</li>
                    <li>You may become more committed to study because the group members are depending on your presentation and participation. You will not want to let them down.</li>
                    <li>Group members will listen and discuss information and concepts during the study sessions. These activities add a strong auditory dimension to your learning experience.</li>
                    <li>One or more group members are likely to understand something you do not. They may bring up ideas you never considered.</li>
                    <li>You can learn valuable new study habits from the other group members.</li>
                    <li>You can compare your class notes with those of the other group members to clarify your notes and fill in any gaps.</li>
                    <li>Teaching/explaining information and concepts to the other group members will help you reinforce your mastery of the information and concepts.</li>
                    <li>There's an old axiom that goes: "if you put 100 programmers in a room and give them 1 problem, you'll get 100 different answers, and most will work." By studying with others you'll be able to see how others approach the questions and exercises you'll be studying. When I study for a certification, my initial approach to a problem is rarely the best one. But if I'm studying with others, I can see many approaches and find out which one is best for me.</li>
                    <li>Let's face it - studying can sometimes be boring. Interacting with the other group members can make studying enjoyable.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4>Getting a Study Group Started</h4>
                  <p>Study groups don't just happen.  Here is what you should do to get a study group started:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Talk to your classmates, from the same city, about forming a study group.</li>
                    <li>Invite enough of these classmates to work with you in a study group until you have formed a group of three to five.  A larger group may allow some members to avoid responsibility, may lead to cliques, and may make group management more of an issue than learning.</li>
                    <li>Once, you have selected a group from the same city, you can create a group on <a href="http://groups.google.com/">http://groups.google.com/</a></li>
                    <li>To create a name for your study group, here is an example: Suppose someone wants to form a group for participants from Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra, India. They will need to use the ISO abbreviation. Therefore, it will be: RubyLearning-IN-MH-Mumbai. For someone starting it in Fortaleza city in Ceara state - Brazil, it will be: RubyLearning-BR-CE-Fortaleza.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4>Conditions on using RubyLearning's name and logo</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Your study group should always link back to <a href="http://rubylearning.org/">http://rubylearning.org/</a> and should refer to RubyLearning with R and L capital (brand name). Please add the RubyLearning logo to your group, the html code of which can be requested from satish [at] rubylearning [dot] org</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4>Advantages on using RubyLearning's name and logo</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>RubyLearning has been in the business of teaching since 2005 and has a definitive market value. Therefore, using RubyLearning's name and logo will give visibility and credibility to your local group.</li>
                    <li>As the number of local study groups grow, this World-wide rubylearning.github.iomunity will be a force to reckon with, in the Ruby world. RubyLearning teachers from their native languages could be made available (under request) to local industries and people, through the good offices of RubyLearning. The advantages are many.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h4>Characteristics of a Successful Study Group</h4>
                  <p>Once started, a study group should possess the following characteristics to be successful:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Each group member contributes to discussions.</li>
                    <li>The group members work collaboratively to resolve any concern raised by a group member.</li>
                    <li>Group members are prompt and come prepared to work.</li>
                    <li>The group stays on task with respect to its agenda.</li>
                    <li>Group members show respect for each other.</li>
                    <li>Group members feel free to criticize each other but keep their criticisms constructive. This can encourage group members to reveal their weaknesses so that they can strengthen them.</li>
                    <li>Group members feel free to ask questions of each other.</li>
                    <li>At the end of each study session, an agenda including specific group member responsibilities is prepared for the next session.</li>
                    <li>Above all, the positive attitude that "we can do this together" is maintained.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h4>Possible Pitfalls of a Study Group</h4>
                  <p>A study group can be a very positive learning experience. However, there are pitfalls to be avoided. Here are some cautions:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Do not let the study group get distracted from its agenda and goals.</li>
                    <li>Do not let the study group become a social group. You can always socialize at other times.</li>
                    <li>Do not allow group members to attend unprepared. To stay in the group, members should be required to do their fair share.</li>
                    <li>Do not the let the session become a negative forum for complaining about teachers and courses.</li>
                    <li>Do not allow one or two group members to dominate the group. It is important that all members have an equal opportunity to participate.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>The information you just read will help you decide when a study group is appropriate for you and will help ensure its success. So why are we waiting for? Let's start creating these Ruby Study Groups.</p>
