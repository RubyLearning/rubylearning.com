                <h3>Why and What's JRuby?</h3>

                <p>JRuby is a 100% pure-Java implementation of the Ruby programming language.</p>

                <p>Recently, <strong>JRuby</strong> has been gaining more and more attention in the Java and Ruby communities. Java is a powerful platform and there are millions of lines of Java code being written each month, that the world will have to live with for a long time from now. By leveraging Java the platform with the power of the Ruby programming language, programmers will get the best from both worlds. You better not ignore JRuby any more!</p>
                <p class="post-note">"For Ruby Developers, JRuby offers a deployment platform that is well understood, particular in corporations. For a Java community, JRuby is important because it offers a chance to experience a powerful language and framework while still taking advantage of Java's excellent libraries and the ability to work in both Ruby and Java." - <strong>Martin Fowler</strong></p>
