I am glad that I took this course and would like to continue advancing my skills in Ruby and Ruby on Rails ultimately. <span class="underline">An advice to new subscribers, please do not consider this course easy in any way, but once you put in the effort and time it is certainly worth it</span>.

It is truly effective the way you learn, by sharing code and discusing each topic; you get an insight that you won't get just by reading the material and studying by your self. The teachers are great and they go a long way to make you understand, in a friendly way, your misconceptions and what you are doing wrong. You get the oportunity to see different answers for the same problem from your classmates and compliment each others knowledge. I can safely say that you learn as much from your classmates as from your teachers. <span class="underline">Best online course ever</span>.</td>

This way of learning is much better than reading books - you have lessons, exercises, home projects and forums to share with others. Support that I got from the assistant teachers and other students was invaluable to me.

Since then I've became an active part of the Ruby course community. The most important idea of the course is "Participate and Share". This was something I absolutely couldn't learn from books. I am covinced that helping others with their code problems, helped me to learn Ruby faster.

Even more discouraging was the fact that I had been reading several well regarded Ruby books over a period of about 4 months, and I still didn't understand enough about the language to write very useful programs. The course made a huge difference for me. <span class="underline">I learned more in my first four weeks in the course than I had in the previous four months</span>. I can recognize a number of specific ways that the course helped me. Being in the course forced me to focus on particular aspects of learning Ruby each week. That's a lot more effective than moving from topic to topic as I had been. Being able to read other people's comments and questions helped tremendously. There are many concepts that most people simply don't grasp the first time they encounter them, but that they will find simple once they learn more. When I was trying to teach myself Ruby from books, I expected that I should master each concept as I encountered it, and I spent many frustrating hours trying to grasp concepts that I simply wasn't ready for. Comments from Satish and others taught me to move on, and that everything would eventually become clear once I had learning other lessons. Working though the assignments helped to clarify many things for me as well, and being able to ask questions when I encountered something that I didn't understand helped tremendously. I still have a lot to learn, but now I find that I can read most of the code in books like Ruby Cookbook and understand what is happening, and most of the books I was struggling to understand before taking the course seem much more approachable now. Thank you to Satish Talim, the assistant teachers, and my helpful fellow students.</td>

I started to learn Ruby before I heard about rubylearning.org, but for me it was a problem to start from the beginning and have all the basic concepts and technics of the language lined up and grasped in a nice sequence of lessons. To cover up everything I needed some external motivation - this course made me do it, and I am happy now because I have a better understanding of the whole picture of the Ruby programming language. This will help me in the future. Participants and Satish Talim as the host were really responsive and gave me a hand when I was struggling with some misunderstandings or would stumble against issues I could not fully grasp. <span class="underline">That is the strongest side of this course - helpful and friendly community.

My real work load caught up with me about 3 weeks ago, so I had to reduce my time spent on Ruby. However, I now use Ruby whenever I want to tackle a new problem, that I would have done in other languages (VB.Net or Cache). For example, I am a big fantasy sports fan and help run a league. Every year, we create new team divisions which has been a manual, time consuming process. However, with Ruby, I was able to write code that will automate this process so that it only take a few minutes tops to input the parameters and then seconds to generate the teams for each division.</td>

<td>I've learned Pascal, C, LISP, C++, Java and other languages while I was at the University. When I started working I had to learn - on the job training - Delphi, and from then on I realized that most programming languages are more or less easy to learn if one invests time and has a book or some source of information to get started. This way I've learned Perl, PHP, PL/SQL and a small set of others. But in doing so I never really felt that I had properly learned about each one. And I was afraid that the same thing would happen to me while learning by following online books, articles and other references. Until... until I stumbled on a link that pointed out to a Free Online Course for Ruby. Being online was a major advantage for me, due to time constraints, and being free was a plus since money is short and my company only invests in "well-known" languages. The first 2 to 3 weeks, after the course started, I was mostly on "reading-mode" in the forums and was satisfied to accomplish the exercises and quiz. Until, due to some discussion in a thread, I realized that I had to participate more, and more often, in the forums. By doing so then suddenly, easily, almost without realizing I started to feel that I'm really learning how to code in Ruby. And that what I learn makes sense even when applied in other scenarios instead of being just a huge pile of "glued blocks of code". It's code that I can re-use, that I understand - probably more than in other languages - and that is fun. That is indeed a major advantage of Ruby: coding is fun! And as Marcos and others have mentioned: <span class="underline">this course is about participation and sharing, to which I add "discuss" as well</span>. One final word to thank Satish, for his dedication, efforts and commitment in the success of this online course and to thank the community of participants, from teachers to students (which is growing and I'm so glad to be a part of it).</td>

In this course, since there are a many participants asking questions related to the language and programming practices, any participant can get all s/he needs to know. On the other hand, each participant has the wonderful opportunity of comparing various styles of programming. Styles are not only set by functions used but the number of code lines, complexity and the commenting way. You can find all this information in books but only during collaboration will you be able to compare because usually books contain only one variant of problem solving. <span class="underline">Therefore if you want to find your own way in this language then this course will be great for you.</span></td>

<td>I am glad for having had this opportunity to study Ruby with Satish and so many other outstanding programmers. Their collective input has given me many insights that I would never have garnered simply from reading Ruby books (which I now have done). As a beginner (both with Ruby and programming), I knew that the road to learning would be a steep upward climb...but it has been leveled considerably by the format and structure of this course, and mostly by reading the forum discussions! What wonderful, lively and engaging discussions of the coding world of Ruby. I am glad I learned enough Ruby to appreciate these discussions and hopefully in the near future my Ruby prowess will allow me to contribute as well... <span class="underline">I think the learning revolution via Internet is starting to gather momentum and Satish is definitely pioneering this movement with his engaging Ruby learning courses</span>. Many thanks and I now, thanks to this course, have Ruby running in my veins...and hopefully pumping life into my programming attempts to put Ruby to work in the information dense world of the life sciences.
