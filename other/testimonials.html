                <p class="testimonial" title="Peter Cooper of RubyInside"><strong><span style="color:#B37400;">Peter Cooper</span></strong>: One problem I experience when learning new languages is that while it's easy to plough through a book and feel pretty smart at the end.. when you come to writing code, you start to realize you need to read all that stuff again a few times until it sinks in. With that in mind, <span class="underline">I'd recommend Satish Talim's bumper collection of Ruby tutorials that cover similar ground to Programming Ruby</span> but, naturally, approach things from a slightly different direction. Seeing it all over again is more likely to get the knowledge to stick. <strong>Peter Cooper</strong> is the author of '<a href="/blog/2007/03/28/beginning-ruby/">Beginning Ruby</a>' book.</p>

It couldn't be easier to study. <span class="underline">I also think your eBook is really great and complete</span>.

Afterwards I cannot say, why no other tutorial could keep my attention for long enough to spark my interest. Finally I am happy to stay with the little Ruby community, that evolves around the site and its online class and am casually becoming productive with Ruby. <span class="underline">You made me first comprehend the basics of a language which is very different from those, I knew before</span>, and in the end curious for my future Ruby-adventures.

But since these are generally very expensive, I found Satish's free online course and signed up for a test. By the end of the fourth week I had already changed my mind completely. <span class="underline">The course is totally serious and I have learned a lot, even more than if it was presencial</span>. Satish is a great teacher and always helped me when I needed. I'm sure that any person who enrolls for the new batches will learn as much as (or more than) I did.</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Jose Carlos Monteiro, Portugal"><strong><span style="color:#B37400;">Jose Carlos Monteiro</span></strong>: I've learned Pascal, C, LISP, C++, Java and other languages while I was at the University. When I started working I had to learn - on the job training - Delphi, and from then on I realized that most programming languages are more or less easy to learn if one invests time and has a book or some source of information to get started. This way I've learned Perl, PHP, PL/SQL and a small set of others. But in doing so I never really felt that I had properly learned about each one. And I was afraid that the same thing would happen to me while learning by following online books, articles and other references. Until... until I stumbled on a link that pointed out to a Free Online Course for Ruby. Being online was a major advantage for me, due to time constraints, and being free was a plus since money is short and my company only invests in "well-known" languages. The first 2 to 3 weeks, after the course started, I was mostly on "reading-mode" in the forums and was satisfied to accomplish the exercises and quiz. Until, due to some discussion in a thread, I realized that I had to participate more, and more often, in the forums. By doing so then suddenly, easily, almost without realizing I started to feel that I'm really learning how to code in Ruby. And that what I learn makes sense even when applied in other scenarios instead of being just a huge pile of "glued blocks of code". It's code that I can re-use, that I understand - probably more than in other languages - and that is fun. That is indeed a major advantage of Ruby: coding is fun! And as Marcos and others have mentioned: <span class="underline">this course is about participation and sharing, to which I add "discuss" as well</span>. One final word to thank Satish, for his dedication, efforts and commitment in the success of this online course and to thank the community of participants, from teachers to students (which is growing and I'm so glad to be a part of it).</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Al Snow, USA"><strong><span style="color:#B37400;">Al Snow</span></strong>: After learning about Ruby at 2006 NFJS conference, I bought books, subscribed to Ruby/Rails podcasts, and attended Atlanta Ruby user group, but did not spend much time learning or using the language. When I saw the course announcement this January (2008), I knew the structure of a class would help me, so I signed up immediately. <span class="underline">This is much more than a course - this is a "open-source" community of sharing regular training material/exercises/quizzes and of contributing to each other learning through blogs, wikis, forums, and emails</span>. As an example, in addition to read the material and doing the exercises and course project, I have contributed through exercise solutions, course ideas, unit tests, and external references (i.e., Google Summer of Code, 99 Problems Solutions). I have really enjoyed it and invite everyone to come and join our growing Ruby community in learning and sharing.</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Renato Candido, Brazil"><strong>Renato Candido</strong>: The collaborative work existed long before the Internet was created but its creation was responsible for increasing interaction amongst people very distant from each other. Free software came from it. Among free software, we have Ruby and Ruby on Rails. <span class="underline">This course reflects exactly this ideology: Collaborative work</span>. I'm new to Ruby and the course was a very good start to this amazing language. The studying notes, the discussion forums, the exercises, the teacher's work and  specially the students, make this a very good place for learning the language basics and new programming techniques through collaborative work. I'd like to thank Satish for this resource.</p>

My real work load caught up with me about 3 weeks ago, so I had to reduce my time spent on Ruby. However, I now use Ruby whenever I want to tackle a new problem, that I would have done in other languages (VB.Net or Cache). For example, I am a big fantasy sports fan and help run a league. Every year, we create new team divisions which has been a manual, time consuming process. However, with Ruby, I was able to write code that will automate this process so that it only take a few minutes tops to input the parameters and then seconds to generate the teams for each division.</p>

I started to learn Ruby before I heard about rubylearning.org, but for me it was a problem to start from the beginning and have all the basic concepts and technics of the language lined up and grasped in a nice sequence of lessons. To cover up everything I needed some external motivation - this course made me do it, and I am happy now because I have a better understanding of the whole picture of the Ruby programming language. This will help me in the future. Participants and Satish Talim as the host were really responsive and gave me a hand when I was struggling with some misunderstandings or would stumble against issues I could not fully grasp. <span class="underline">That is the strongest side of this course - helpful and friendly community. My colleagues made me feel very comfortable here and showed me one more time that learning and coding in Ruby _is_ fun! And the more fun it is, the more productive you are and everyone is happy</span>.</p>

Their collective input has given me many insights that I would never have garnered simply from reading Ruby books (which I now have done). As a beginner (both with Ruby and programming), I knew that the road to learning would be a steep upward climb...but it has been leveled considerably by the format and structure of this course, and mostly by reading the forum discussions! What wonderful, lively and engaging discussions of the coding world of Ruby. I am glad I learned enough Ruby to appreciate these discussions and hopefully in the near future my Ruby prowess will allow me to contribute as well... <span class="underline">I think the learning revolution via Internet is starting to gather momentum and Satish is definitely pioneering this movement with his engaging Ruby learning courses</span>. Many thanks and I now, thanks to this course, have Ruby running in my veins...and hopefully pumping life into my programming attempts to put Ruby to work in the information dense world of the life sciences. Many thanks for a wonderful learning experience!</p>

As soon as I read some books on this language I knew that this language was worthy exploring. I was also looking for other ways to learn Ruby. Then, while googling, I came across the Free Online Ruby Programming Course by Satish Talim. I can say, without any hesitation, that it was the most valuable click I ever made. I found that the most efficient way to learn Ruby was exchanging information with other participants. Slowly, I got more and more involved. Since then I've became an active part of the Ruby course community. The most important idea of the course is "Participate and Share". This was something I absolutely couldn't learn from books. I am covinced that helping others with their code problems, helped me to learn Ruby faster. This course also helped me to get familiar with such an interesting language as Ruby, in a human-friendly way. This course is the best for newbies, but professionals can also learn a lot too. The level of learning is really flexible, and everyone can take advantage of it. <span class="underline">Thank you Satish for always being there, whenever we  needed help</span>.</p>

It doesn't matter if you have an extensive background in programming or if you are like me, new to programming and Ruby is your first taste of this complex world! <span class="underline">Satish's course is wonderful. It teaches you everything you need to know to start programming. What makes it better than all the books out there are the assignments you get, not only do you have to compose your own unique code but you can see how other people cope up with the tasks, which makes the learning experience so much better that learning alone. Plus the community is great and Satish is a wonderful teacher</span>.</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Jim Pryke, Canada"><strong><span style="color:#B37400;">Jim Pryke</span></strong>: When I first came across Satish Talim's Ruby course, I knew that I wanted very much to learn Ruby, but I didn't know if I would ever succeed. I hadn't taken any formal training in computer science since 1985, and I had tried with very little success to learn Perl and PHP from books starting in the 1990s. Even more discouraging was the fact that I had been reading several well regarded Ruby books over a period of about 4 months, and I still didn't understand enough about the language to write very useful programs. The course made a huge difference for me. <span class="underline">I learned more in my first four weeks in the course than I had in the previous four months</span>. I can recognize a number of specific ways that the course helped me. Being in the course forced me to focus on particular aspects of learning Ruby each week. That's a lot more effective than moving from topic to topic as I had been. Being able to read other people's comments and questions helped tremendously. There are many concepts that most people simply don't grasp the first time they encounter them, but that they will find simple once they learn more. When I was trying to teach myself Ruby from books, I expected that I should master each concept as I encountered it, and I spent many frustrating hours trying to grasp concepts that I simply wasn't ready for. Comments from Satish and others taught me to move on, and that everything would eventually become clear once I had learning other lessons. Working though the assignments helped to clarify many things for me as well, and being able to ask questions when I encountered something that I didn't understand helped tremendously. I still have a lot to learn, but now I find that I can read most of the code in books like Ruby Cookbook and understand what is happening, and most of the books I was struggling to understand before taking the course seem much more approachable now. Thank you to Satish Talim, the assistant teachers, and my helpful fellow students.</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Peter Crawford, Italy"><strong>Peter Crawford</strong>: I came to the Ruby Learning course after a couple of months of playing with RoR, soon realizing that the Ruby part was more crucial than the Rails part - especially since I was seeking a solution to a specific problem which no amount of newbie "code-pasting" was going to solve. <span class="underline">What a great experience this course has been! I got my first real taste of a programming language (as opposed to html and css) in the company of a wonderful community of learners, sharing our successes (and mistakes) together. The assistant teachers were fantastic, ever willing to help, and Mr. Talim is to be congratulated heartily for having assembled such an excellent forum in which to learn Ruby</span>. (And, by the way, I solved that little problem in RoR...).</p>

Thank you all for the patience, attention and opportunity.</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Barrie Hill, Australia"><strong>Barrie Hill</strong>: Thanks Satish, for making this course available. I have participated in quite a number of courses over the last few years from computer based training to instructor led in a class room. <span class="underline">The  FORPC101 - Core Ruby Programming course I have just completed is the best study format I have participated. The course being paced over a number of weeks is much easier to absorb than sitting in a classroom for a week. The dedicated band of assistant instructors form all around the world make all the difference. Access to people who provide help with problems when asked is invaluable</span>. I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn Ruby.</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Adnan Abbas, Malaysia"><strong>Adnan Abbas</strong>: When I subscribed for this course I did not realize that it will be that demanding in terms of your time. But I knew I had to put in a lot of time every week (10 hours+) to be active on the forums and do all my exercises / quizzes. In the end, it was really fun learning Ruby with all the Asst. Teachers and Satish helping and guiding you. I am glad that I took this course and would like to continue advancing my skills in Ruby and Ruby on Rails ultimately. <span class="underline">An advice to new subscribers, please do not consider this course easy in any way, but once you put in the effort and time it is certainly worth it</span>. I have never seen such dedicated bunch of individuals helping to develop a programming language community and RUBY certainly deserves it.</p>

                <p class="testimonial" title="Felipe Ureta, Ecuador"><strong>Felipe Ureta</strong>: I love the approach the course has. It is truly effective the way you learn, by sharing code and discusing each topic; you get an insight that you won't get just by reading the material and studying by your self. The teachers are great and they go a long way to make you understand, in a friendly way, your misconceptions and what you are doing wrong. You get the oportunity to see different answers for the same problem from your classmates and compliment each others knowledge. I can safely say that you learn as much from your classmates as from your teachers. <span class="underline">Best online course ever</span>.</p>

Here in my country (Bolivia - South America) the people are starting to know about this powerful language and I'll recommend this online free course, Also the course helped me understand concepts and principles of Ruby core. Currently, I develop  Web applications in the Java programming language and I am considering use RoR from now, I also see that Ruby is becoming a very popular language, Once Again Thanks!!</p>
